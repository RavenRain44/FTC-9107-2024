# FTC Team 9107 Robot Code

Created for use during Olathe Northwest's in-house competition of the 2024-2025 FIRST Tech Challenge game INTO THE DEEP presented by RTX.

This repository operates under the [FTCLib command-based framework](https://docs.ftclib.org/ftclib), closely based on the WPILib framework used in FRC. It also uses [RoadRunner](https://rr.brott.dev/docs/) for movement. For future projects, take note of version changes within each dependency.

Below is a list of some additional resources that were useful while creating this repository:
* [FTC Team 9103 2022 Robot Code](https://github.com/Andrew-K961/FTC-9103-2022-code)
* [FTC Team 9110 2023 Robot Code](https://github.com/Mr-A768/FTC-9110-2023)

*Note: This project will not work as-is, as it lacks the [official FTC framework](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController) and the external application dependencies. This is intended for reference use only.*
